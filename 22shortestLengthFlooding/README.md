implement a controlled flooding algorithm (with a sequence number) and add a value called "length" to the message.
When an actor receives a message, it increments the "lentgh" by 1 and transmits the message with the incremented value to its neighboors.

Run the algorithm by starting with actor A and answer those questions: 
- how many messages are received by P ? 
- What is the lowest value "length" received by P ?

Now run the algorithm by starting with actor L and answer those questions:
- how many messages are received by P ?
- What is the lowest value "length" received by P ?

Now run the algorithm by starting with actor I and answer those questions:
- how many messages are received by Q ?
- What is the lowest value "length" received by Q ?

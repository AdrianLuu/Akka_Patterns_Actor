24: the "mini-project" pattern DHT/Kamdelia! be careful, this one is very long and complex ! It is bonus task!

do the top priority first, then the medium and if you have time (but it might be boring) the others, but it's more interesting to do the 23 as soon as possible !

Notes: for the pattern 10, the scheduler "call" should be usually in the constructor of one actor

starting pattern 10: when actors need references to other actors at the beginning, send the references by message preferably, even if those messages don't appear in the visual representation of the pattern (for the sake of simplicity)# SLR203_Akka_ActorModel
